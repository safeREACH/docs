## üéØ Purpose & Access

---

The Messaging API allows transactional sending of ad-hoc messages via multiple communication channels (SMS, EMAIL, VOICE, PUSH). It is designed for flexible, low-latency delivery in critical systems.

The API supports:

- Multi-channel fallback delivery
- In-app push notifications (safeREACH app)
- Voice call retries
- Language and title control for push messages
- Per-target delivery error reporting

### ‚úÖ API Credentials

Messaging API access **requires credentials issued by the safeREACH Support Team**.

- These are **not** the same as User API credentials.
- Required fields:
    - `customerId`
    - `username`
    - `password`

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Contact support@safereach.com to request credentials.
